    The source of the Rio Negro lies in Colombia, in the Department of Guainía where the river is known as Guainía River.
    <br> The young river generally flows in an east-northeasterly direction through the Puinawai National Reserve, <br>
    passing several small indigenous settlements on its way, such as Cuarinuma, Brujas, Santa Rosa and Tabaquén. <br>
    After roughly 400 km the river starts forming the border between Colombia's Department of Guainía and Venezuela's Amazonas State.<br>
     After passing the Colombian community of Tonina and Macanal the river turns Southwest. <br>
     Maroa is the first Venezuelan town the river passes. <br>120 km further downstream the river receives the Casiquiare canal from the right-hand, forming a unique link between the Orinoco and the Amazon river basin. <br>
     Henceforth the river is called Rio Negro.
